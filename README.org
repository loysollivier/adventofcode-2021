#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2021 solutions

My simple solutions to [[https://adventofcode.com/2021][Advent of code 2021]].

- Days:
  - [[day1/day1.py][Day 1]]
  - [[day2/day2.py][Day 2]]
  - [[day3/day3.py][Day 3]]
  - [[day4/day4.py][Day 4]]
  - [[day5/day5.py][Day 5]]
  - [[day6/day6.py][Day 6]]
    - This one was fun. The first solution did not scale for part 2.
      Then the idea came up on how to do it more efficiently.
  - [[day7/day7.py][Day 7]]
    - Looks like I could be using a math formula (like barycenter ?) for it.
      But the brute approach did work...
  - [[day8/day8.py][Day 8]]
    - Part 1: Easy, gives you hints on how to find the combination for part 2.
    - Part 2: Once the strategy was established writing the code was easy.
